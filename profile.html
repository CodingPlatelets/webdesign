		<h1>Lionel Messi</h1>
		<p>Lionel Andrés Messi is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris
			Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all
			time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was
			named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career
			with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles
			and four UEFA Champions Leagues. </p>
		<p>Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at the age of 13, for whom he
			made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club
			within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the
			first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons
			followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four
			times and in a row.During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored
			in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons,
			Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining
			his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a
			historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of
			Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out of contract, he signed for Paris
			Saint-Germain in August 2021.</p>
